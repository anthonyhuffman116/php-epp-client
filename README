Object-oriented PHP EPP Client

Welcome to the object-oriented EPP client in PHP project

This code will provide you with a fully functional EPP client to connect to any registry world-wide.

All code is organized in objects, so connecting to a new registry is just a matter of object re-use and extension.

Samples are provided in the Registries directory. An sample connect script is provided in eppTest.php
