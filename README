Object-oriented PHP EPP Client

Welcome to the object-oriented EPP client in PHP project

This code will provide you with a fully functional EPP client to connect to any registry world-wide.

All code is organized in objects, so connecting to a new registry is just a matter of object re-use and extension.

Sample registry connections are provided in the Registries directory.

Sample domain check an domain create scripts are provided in checkdomain.php and registerdomain.php
