Object-oriented PHP EPP Client

Welcome to the object-oriented EPP client in PHP project. 

This project supports the following:
- Full EPP 57xx RFC standard
- Fully extensible PHP objects to add registry-specific extensions
- Rock-solid object-oriented programming, object inheritance and exception handling
- Interface tested and in use with a registrar that handles 500.000+ domain names
- Public/private key client certificates for connecting to EPP service (for example see Registries/IIS)
- Connection to EPP via HTTP/SSL (for example see Registries/Openprovider)
- DNSSEC transactions
- Registry sunrise and landrush periods (draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase)

This code will provide you with a fully functional EPP client to connect to any registry world-wide that supports EPP.

All code is organized in objects, so connecting to a new registry is just a matter of object re-use and extension.

Sample registry connections are provided in the Registries directory.

Sample scipts in the main directory:
checkdomain.php - check one domain name
checkdomains.php - check multiple domain names with one call
registerdomain.php - register a domain name
changepassword.php - change EPP password
infodomain.php - get information on a domain name
modifydomain.php  - update a domain name
signdomain.php - DNSSEC sign a domain name
poll.php - list registry poll messages
checklaunchdomain.php - check domain name in 'claims' phase of draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase
createlaunchdomain.php - register domain name in 'claims' phase of draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase
