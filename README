Object-oriented PHP EPP Client

Welcome to the object-oriented EPP client in PHP project. 

This project supports the following:
- Full EPP 57xx RFC standard
- Fully extensible PHP objects to add registry-specific extensions
- Public/private key client certificates for connecting to EPP service
- Connection to EPP via HTTP/SSL (yes, some registries/registrars do this)
- DNSSEC transactions 
- Rock-solid object-oriented programming and exception handling
- Interface tested and in use with a registrar that handles 500.000+ domain names

This code will provide you with a fully functional EPP client to connect to any registry world-wide that supports EPP.

All code is organized in objects, so connecting to a new registry is just a matter of object re-use and extension.

Sample registry connections are provided in the Registries directory.

Sample domain check an domain create scripts are provided in checkdomain.php and registerdomain.php
